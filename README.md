## What is this?
Script to scrape the Michelin guide for one particular country at a time

## How to use
```
python scraper.py --country $COUNTRY_NAME

You can find the list of countries under the `countries` folder.

Outputs a CSV.  I personally use this CSV to upload to Google Maps.  Go to `mymaps.google.com` and create a new layer.
